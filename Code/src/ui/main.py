-----------------------THE_PROBLEM_STATEMENT----------------------------------
The application must implement algorithms for: 
-arithmetic operations: 
    addition, 
    subtraction, 
    multiplication and division by one digit  
    in a base p{2,3,...,9,10,16}
    
-conversions of natural numbers between two bases p,q{2,3,...,9,10,16} 
    using the substitution method or successive divisions 
    and rapid conversions between two bases p,q {2, 4, 8, 16}.

and  must have a menu such that all operations and conversion methods 
to be verified separately.
